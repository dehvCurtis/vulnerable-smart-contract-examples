        "description": "EIP-7702 Front-Running Attack:\n\nCurrent code (VULNERABLE):\nfunction initialize(...) public {\nrequire(owner == address(0));\nowner = newOwner;  // ❌ Attacker can front-run!\n}\n\nAttack sequence:\n1. User signs EIP-7702 authorization\n2. Attacker sees authorization in mempool\n3. Attacker front-runs with initialize(attackerAddress)\n4. User's delegation is now controlled by attacker\n5. Attacker drains all assets\n\nFix 1: Authorization-based initialization\nfunction initialize(address _owner, bytes memory signature) public {\nrequire(owner == address(0));\n\n// ✅ Verify user signed this specific initialization\nbytes32 hash = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_owner, address(this)));\naddress signer = ECDSA.recover(hash, signature);\nrequire(signer == _owner, \"Invalid signature\");\n\nowner = _owner;\n}\n\nFix 2: Constructor initialization (if possible)\nconstructor(address _owner) {\nowner = _owner;  // ✅ Set during deployment\n}\n\nFix 3: Factory pattern with immediate initialization\ncontract DelegateFactory {\nfunction createDelegate() public returns (address) {\nDelegate delegate = new Delegate(msg.sender);\nreturn address(delegate);\n}\n}\n\nFix 4: Commit-reveal with time-lock\nmapping(bytes32 => uint256) public commitments;\n\nfunction commitInit(bytes32 commitment) public {\ncommitments[commitment] = block.timestamp;\n}\n\nfunction initialize(address _owner, bytes32 salt) public {\nbytes32 commitment = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(_owner, salt));\nrequire(commitments[commitment] > 0, \"No commitment\");\nrequire(block.timestamp >= commitments[commitment] + 10 minutes);\n\nowner = _owner;\n}\n\nReal-World Loss: $1.54M (August 2025)",
